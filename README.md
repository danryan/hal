## Getting started

["Good morning, Dr. Chandra. This is HAL. I'm ready for my first lesson." ![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/nXgboDb9ucE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXgboDb9ucE#t=180 "Good morning, Dr. Chandra. This is HAL. I'm ready for my first lesson.")

Hal is Go all the way down, and uses standard packages wherever possible. For an idea of how you can use it, look at [a simple example](examples/simple/main.go), or [a more complex example](examples/complex/main.go). Please see below for additional resources.
